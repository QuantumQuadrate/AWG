# Signadyne AWG Card code and driver installer. 

In AWG/SignadyneResources/drivers_and_installers, run the Essentials installer to install the Signadyne drivers. 

All of the scripts in this repo run correctly on Rb's PXI crate as of 9/1/2021. See SignadyneResources/preston_awg_notes.pdf for detailed notes on troubleshooting some common issues. 

Note that there are older scripts by Xiaoyu on the wiki as well as on a flash drive in Mark's office but THESE DO NOT ALL WORK. Additionally, he used a Keysight module for some things; this does not seem at all necessary.
